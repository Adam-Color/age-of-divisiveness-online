![Age of Divisiveness](resources/images/aod_logo.png?raw=true)

## Game Description
In a time of great conflict, new kingdoms are born in minds of ambitious rules and willing hearts of dedicated serfs. 
Every great kingdom needs a powerful **army**, vivid homeland **culture** and thoughtful **diplomacy**.
Be ready to conquer civilizations and win extensive battles, in which the key to defeating your enemy will be both hands and minds.  
Will you win by being a despotic tyrant or maybe by creating a web of secret pacts?  
Will your kingdom story be written by romantic tales or fearful half lies?  
Nevertheless, keep your kingdom in order and do not find your domain in the age of divisiveness.
